# Tourist Safety App - Fixes Applied

## Issue Resolution Summary

### Original Problem
The app was failing to bundle with the error:
```
Unable to resolve "react-native-reanimated" from "utils\gestureNavigation.js"
```

### Root Cause
Missing dependencies and incomplete service implementations were causing import failures during the bundling process.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Missing Dependencies Added âœ…
Added the following missing dependencies to `package.json`:

```json
{
  "react-native-reanimated": "~3.16.1",
  "react-native-screens": "~4.4.0", 
  "@react-native-community/netinfo": "^11.4.1",
  "expo-linear-gradient": "~14.0.1",
  "expo-file-system": "~18.0.4",
  "expo-media-library": "~16.0.5"
}
```

### 2. Babel Configuration Updated âœ…
Updated `babel.config.js` to include the react-native-reanimated plugin:

```javascript
plugins: [
  ["module:react-native-dotenv", { /* config */ }],
  'react-native-reanimated/plugin'  // Added this line
]
```

### 3. Missing Services Created âœ…

#### Created `offlineCacheService.js`
- Handles offline data caching for essential app functionality
- Provides encrypted storage for sensitive data
- Manages cache expiry and cleanup
- Location: `services/offline/offlineCacheService.js`

#### Created `notificationService.js`
- General notification service for all app notifications
- Handles local and push notifications
- Manages notification permissions and scheduling
- Location: `services/notifications/notificationService.js`

#### Created `realtimeService.js`
- Handles real-time data synchronization
- Manages connection status and reconnection logic
- Provides event-based communication
- Location: `services/realtime/realtimeService.js`

### 4. Jest Configuration Fixed âœ…
Updated `jest.config.js` with proper configuration:
- Fixed syntax errors
- Added proper transform patterns for react-native-reanimated
- Configured module name mapping

## Verification Results

### Bundle Status: âœ… SUCCESS
```
Android Bundled 2951ms index.js (1889 modules)
```
