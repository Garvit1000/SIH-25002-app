## Navigation Integration

The privacy features are integrated into the main app navigation:
- Privacy settings accessible from ProfileScreen
- Modal presentations for data deletion and grievance forms
- Proper navigation stack management

## Testing

Comprehensive test suite implemented:
- Unit tests for privacy service functionality
