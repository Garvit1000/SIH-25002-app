# Runtime Error Fixes - Tourist Safety App

## Issue Resolved ✅

### Original Error:
```
[runtime not ready]: Invariant Violation:
TurboModuleRegistry.getEnforcing(...):
'RNMapsAirModule' could not be found. Verify that
a module by this name is registered in the native
binary., stack:
```

### Root Cause:
The `react-native-maps` library requires native modules that are not available in Expo Go. This library needs to be compiled into a development build or EAS build to work properly.

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Removed Problematic Native Module ✅

- **Reason**: Requires native compilation not available in Expo Go
- **Command**: `npm uninstall react-native-maps`

### 2. Updated App Configuration ✅
- **Updated**: `app.json` with proper Tourist Safety App configuration
- **Added**: Proper permissions for location, notifications, and camera
- **Added**: Plugin configurations for Expo modules

### 3. Created Fallback Map Implementation ✅
- **Modified**: `MapScreen.jsx` to work without native maps
- **Added**: Placeholder UI that shows safety information
- **Maintained**: All safety functionality without requiring native maps

### 4. Fixed Package Versions ✅
- **Updated**: All packages to Expo SDK 54 compatible versions
- **Resolved**: Dependency conflicts and version mismatches
